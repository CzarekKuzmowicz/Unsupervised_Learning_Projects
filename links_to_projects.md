# Hi!

My name is **Czarek Ku≈∫mowicz** and I'm an aspiring data scientist!
I'm currently a Master's student in **"Data Science and Business Analytics"** at the University of Warsaw.

During my **Unsupervised Learning** Classes I've done 3 projects. Below I'm attaching links to their Rpubs pages.
Hope you'll like it! :)
